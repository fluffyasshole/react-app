There are five major concepts of React:
    1) Components
    2) JSX (JavaScript XML)
    3) Props & State
    4) The component API
    5) Component types

1) How React Components work:
            The original code is only 1 big component which makes up all the codebase consisting of smaller 
            components. A common example of this is a simple HTML element called select as shown in code snippet 
            below:

            <select>
                <option value="value1">Value 1</option>
                <option value="value2">Value 2</option>
                <option value="value3">Value 3</option>
            </select>

            A React element does not onl handle HTML code like traditional template but also includes all the
            controls needed to control the output.
